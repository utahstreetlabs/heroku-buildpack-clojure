# Heroku buildpack: Clojure

This is a Heroku buildpack for Clojure apps. It uses
[Leiningen](http://leiningen.org).

Note that you don't have to do anything special to use this buildpack
with Clojure apps on Heroku; it will be used by default for all
projects containing a project.clj file, though it may be an older
revision than what you're currently looking at.

## Usage

Example usage for an app already stored in git:

    $ tree
    |-- Procfile
    |-- project.clj
    |-- README
    `-- src
        `-- sample
            `-- core.clj

    $ heroku create

    $ git push heroku master
    ...

The buildpack will detect your app as Clojure if it has a
`project.clj` file in the root. If you use the
[clojure-maven-plugin](https://github.com/talios/clojure-maven-plugin),
[the standard Java buildpack](http://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-java)
should work instead.

## Configuration

Leiningen 1.7.1 will be used by default, but if you have
`:min-lein-version "2.0.0"` in project.clj (highly recommended) then
the latest Leiningen 2.x release will be used instead.

Your `Procfile` should declare what process types which make up your
app. Often in development Leiningen projects are launched using `lein
run -m my.project.namespace`, but this is not recommended in
production because it leaves Leiningen running in addition to your
project's process. It also uses profiles that are intended for
development, which can let test libraries and test configuration sneak
into production.

In order to ensure consistent builds, normally values set with `heroku
config:add ...` (other than `LEIN_USERNAME`, `LEIN_PASSWORD`, and
`LEIN_PASSPHRASE`) will not be visible at compile time. To expose more
to the compilation process, set a `BUILD_CONFIG_WHITELIST` config var
containing a space-delimited list of config var names. Note that this
can result in unpredictable behaviour since changing your app's config
does not result in a rebuild of your app. So it's easy to get into a
situation where your build is broken, but you don't notice it until
later when you push. For this reason it's recommended to take care
with this feature and always push after changing a whitelisted config
value.

### Uberjar

If your `project.clj` contains an `:uberjar-name` setting, then
`lein uberjar` will run during deploys. If you do this, your `Procfile`
entries should consist of just `java` invocations.

If your main namespace doesn't have a `:gen-class` then you can use
`clojure.main` as your entry point and indicate your app's main
namespace using the `-m` argument in your `Procfile`:

    web: java $JVM_OPTS -cp target/myproject-standalone.jar clojure.main -m myproject.web

If you have custom settings you would like to only apply during build,
you can place them in an `:uberjar` profile. This can be useful to use
AOT-compiled classes in production but not during development where
they can cause reloading issues:

```clj
  :profiles {:uberjar {:main myproject.web, :aot :all}}
```

If you need Leiningen in a `heroku run` session, it will be downloaded
on-demand.

Note that if you use Leiningen features which affect runtime like
`:jvm-opts`, extraction of native dependencies, or `:java-agents`,
then you'll need to do a little extra work to ensure your Procfile's
`java` invocation includes these things. In these cases it might be
simpler to use Leiningen at runtime instead.

### Leiningen at Runtime

Instead of putting a direct `java` invocation into your Procfile, you
can have Leiningen handle launching your app. If you do this, be sure
to use the `trampoline` and `with-profile` tasks. Trampolining will
cause Leiningen to calculate the classpath and code to run for your
project, then exit and execute your project's JVM, while
`with-profile` will omit development profiles:

    web: lein with-profile production trampoline run -m myapp.web

Including Leiningen in your slug will add about ten megabytes to its
size and will add a second or two of overhead to your app's boot time.

### Overriding build behavior

If neither of these options get you quite what you need, you can check
in your own executable `bin/build` script into your app's repo and it
will be run instead of `compile` or `uberjar` after setting up Leiningen.

## JDK Version

By default you will get OpenJDK 1.6. To use a different version, you
can commit a `system.properties` file to your app.

```
$ echo "java.runtime.version=1.7" > system.properties
$ git add system.properties
$ git commit -m "JDK 7"
```

## Hacking

To change this buildpack, fork it on GitHub. Push up changes to your
fork, then create a test app with `--buildpack YOUR_GITHUB_URL` and
push to it. If you already have an existing app you may use
`heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=YOUR_GITHUB_URL` instead.

For example, you could adapt it to generate a tarball at build time.

Open `bin/compile` in your editor, and replace the block labeled
"Calculate build command" with something like this:

    echo "-----> Generating tar with Leiningen:"
    echo "       Running: lein tar"
    cd $BUILD_DIR
    PATH=.lein/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx500m -Duser.home=$BUILD_DIR" lein tar 2>&1 | sed -u 's/^/       /'
    if [ "${PIPESTATUS[*]}" != "0 0" ]; then
      echo " !     Failed to create tar with Leiningen"
      exit 1
    fi

Commit and push the changes to your buildpack to your GitHub fork,
then push your sample app to Heroku to test. The output should include:

    -----> Generating tar with Leiningen:

If it's something other users would find useful, pull requests are welcome.

## Troubleshooting

To see what the buildpack has produced, do `heroku run bash` and you
will be logged into an environment with your compiled app available.
From there you can explore the filesystem and run `lein` commands.
